# CodeMark🦭

- [Simplified Chinese](ZH_README.md)
- [English](README.md)

Combining the features of "Code" and "Markdown," users can write and execute code within Markdown.

Aiming to reduce the stress of learning programming for students, although local execution is still recommended, an online running experience is good for the initial phase.
