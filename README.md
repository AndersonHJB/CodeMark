# CodeMarkü¶≠

- [Simplified Chinese](ZH_README.md)
- [English](README.md)

CodeMark combines the features of "Code" and "Markdown," allowing users to write and execute code within Markdown documents.

It aims to reduce the learning pressure for students in programming, although local execution is still recommended. However, online execution provides a good initial experience.
